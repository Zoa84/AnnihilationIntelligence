# AnnihilationIntelligence
Final Year Project for Simon Chiu, De Montfort University



Annihilation Intelligence is a 3D 1st Person Horror mobile phone game, developed in Android Studio 
for the Android OS (operating system). This has been developed as a foray into creating and
developing an entire game, as the Computer Games Programming course does not venture far from 
development, and focuses on the coding and programming of a game rather than the game as a whole. 

The overall aim of the project started with exploring the term Horror Vacui as found in the literature
review for the ‘Interim Deadline’. The idea that anything under the horror genre utilised the fear of 
unknown space in order to engage the player was intriguing, as well as the development of a game 
under a genre not touched upon in the course. The development of the game also explored 3D
development for a mobile phone platform, a continuously growing market that many people have access 
to, and the limits both physically, and in computational power, of a mobile phone that 
developers must work with. 

Annihilation Intelligence was developed using Android Studio, utilising j-PCT-AE for 3D, coded in the 
Java programming language, as well as XML for the activity layouts. 3D objects were created in 
Autodesk Maya 2016, along with simple textures, and music and sound effects were created in FL 
Studio, Bfxr, or recorded.
