TODO Next Time


Buttons
Create button class to activate events

Create or otherwise source a floor with objects in it, and import to game activity.

Change or source new music and sound. Currently using "example" music from previous work

Replace old button functionality with Button class


Options
Have pictures be clickable?



!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)

!!Do Fortnightly reports and sign off

Continue writing up about anything at any time (even on phone/ laptop)
