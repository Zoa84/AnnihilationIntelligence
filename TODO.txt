TODO Next Time


Create a pause menu, create as a Menu class, which can be drawn when the game is paused, and will draw a Pause title, a Resume, Return to Menu, Options?

Create or otherwise source a floor with objects in it, and import to game activity.

Change or source new music and sound. Currently using "example" music from previous work



Options
Have pictures be clickable?



!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)

!!Do Fortnightly reports and sign off

Continue writing up about anything at any time (even on phone/ laptop)
