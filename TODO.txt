TODO Next Time


comment up the project

update graphics

instructions, update image with updated graphics?

elevator on floor 4th should be okay when used outside of floor 4 once?

change how joysticks work when out of range? OR leave for questionaire?

move note on floor 4, other side? OR keep hidden, in questionaires it will be reported, then report how i didnt notice as i would skip it myself in testing since i knew

comp in reception, sofas on side? rug?

door knobs lower, or make door overall shorter(compare with recption), reception lower
OR heighten chara?

double sound effect from image in options?

test getting fresh copy from github and running it

make pause menu nicer? (white boarder around menu)







!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)







get screenshots

Testing with other people, recording their thoughts and stuff, and what I can learn from it



Development
what i did when i had problems, searching online for help, tutorials or forums?

debugging, using logs and error messages?

focusing mostly on game engine, when creating actual game, was actual fairly quick due to created architecture, adding in objects takes a few line, new textures or buttons are also quick, basically all about that game engine



Conclusion
