Testing with other people, recording their thoughts and stuff, and what I can learn from it





Development
what i did when i had problems, searching online for help, tutorials or forums?

debugging, using logs and error messages?

focusing mostly on game engine, when creating actual game, was actual fairly quick due to created architecture, adding in objects takes a few line, new textures or buttons are also quick, basically all about that game engine
