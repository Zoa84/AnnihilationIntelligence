http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5643152/multiple-finger-input-for-android-development
Create two joysticks (class?) for the left and right side of screen. Draw a 2d joystick background to show the area of the joystick, as well as a joystick itself, which will move and stay "connected" to the base
Draw the base from the corners of the screen, about 300 in (x and y)

Buttons
Create button class to activate events

Create or otherwise source a floor with objects in it, and import to game activity.

Change or source new music and sound. Currently using "example" music from previous work



Options
Have pictures be clickable?



!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)

!!Do Fortnightly reports and sign off

Continue writing up about anything at any time (even on phone/ laptop)
