Seperate game activity from the surface view



Make all parts of the game landscape, and traverse between all parts of the app, then focus on game
-Under the Android Manifest, the screen orientation for each activity can be set, and by default this is "landspace", where the bottom of the screen is on the right. By setting this to "reverseLandscape", the bottom of the screen is on the left. Have code in the settings to choose which type of landscape, Best would be radio buttons (one or the other) along with pictures to show the user which one is which.

Joystick
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5643152/multiple-finger-input-for-android-development
Create two joysticks (class?) for the left and right side of screen. Draw a 2d joystick background to show the area of the joystick, as well as a joystick itself, which will move and stay "connected" to the base

Buttons
Create button class to activate events

Create or otherwise source a floor with objects in it, and import to game activity.

Change or source new music and sound. Currently using "example" music from previous work



!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)

!!Do Fortnightly reports and sign off

Continue writing up about anything at any time (even on phone/ laptop)
