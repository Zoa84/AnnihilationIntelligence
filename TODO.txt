Begin Creating activities and linking parts together
Seperate game activity from the surface view



Make all parts of the game landscape, and traverse between all parts of the app, then focus on game
-Under the Android Manifest, the screen orientation for each activity can be set, and by default this is "landspace", where the bottom of the screen is on the right. By setting this to "reverseLandscape", the bottom of the screen is on the left. Have code in the settings to choose which type of landscape, Best would be radio buttons (one or the other) along with pictures to show the user which one is which.




TODO Next Time

Be able to save and load from a text file, and be able to push data to the Game Activity (Not necessarily use yet, but create basics so future options can be added)

Create the framework, including loading music and sound and loading data from a text file before working on main game

Create or otherwise source a floor with objects in it, and import to game activity.

Change or source new music and sound. Currently using "example" music from previous work
