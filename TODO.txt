Create third floor and props and stuff
Create fourth floor and props and stuff
Create a link between the two floors

Create or otherwise source a floor with objects in it, and import to game activity.

Change or source new music and sound. Currently using "example" music from previous work



Options
Have pictures be clickable?



!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)

Continue writing up about anything at any time (even on phone/ laptop)


For a simpler? version, only do floors g,1,2,3,4. This gives  the game a chance to have the start, showing off moving in a 3d environment on phone and stuff, and allows simple puzzles, like collecting keycards.
This version would have:

Collect key 1 from desk to go to floor 4
See elevator go live on floor 4 but don't enter
Go to floor 3, use elevator to go to floor 2
get key 2, go to floor 1
get screwdriver from floor 1
go to floor 2 and use on electrics to get code
go to floor 1, input code
go to floor g
walk out

:. 2 key cards, 1 screwdriver
note on 4th floor elev (simple overlay when looking at it?)
have selecting objects (screwdriver) from inventory to then use
Interact with doors, items, stairs - pickup items, when looking at door or elev, click interact, pauses game and has buttons for where to go
game over screen (ui overlay saying game over, and return to menu)
win screen (saying congratulations and return to menu)
sound for picking up items, successful interactions
1 music, unless want more
