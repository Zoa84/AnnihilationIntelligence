TODO Next Time


comment up the project

update graphics

instructions, update image with updated graphics?

elevator on floor 4th should be okay when used outside of floor 4 once?

change how joysticks work when out of range? OR leave for questionaire?

move note on floor 4, other side? OR keep hidden, in questionaires it will be reported, then report how i didnt notice as i would skip it myself in testing since i knew

comp in reception, sofas on side? rug?

door knobs lower, or make door overall shorter(compare with recption), reception lower
OR heighten chara?

double sound effect from image in options?

test getting fresh copy from github and running it










make pause menu nicer? (white boarder around menu)

!!Keep options as is, passing the volume and sound. Not only does this allow us to change the volume of certain music/ sound (e.g. decreasing music for certain sound/ voice) but it is also generally better to not rely on singletons (could research for report?)






Write up topics


about making a whole game by myself, setting uvs, making models, music, etc









get screenshots


For testing or when completed
Testing the code post development



Test cases (appendix)
1A,1B - show data in text file, then data in settings activity, do twice
2A, 2B - picture of directory before and after loading game, 2nd for without dir
3 - show moving between activities, ending the game?
4 - show both radio widgets, explain orientation
5 - show saving data when pressing back, default and save
(Test incorrect text file data? missing after loaded?)
6 - getting calls while app is open, force closing the app
7 - using android back buttons from menu, settings and in-game

sound effects correct
Movement
Turning
Pausing & resuming?
Return to menu
interacting
equip items
between floors in elev and stairs
number pad buttons
game overs
winning




Testing with other people, recording their thoughts and stuff, and what I can learn from it
All the topics ive talked about in Stuff


Development
what i did when i had problems, searching online for help, tutorials or forums?

focusing mostly on game engine, when creating actual game, was actual fairly quick due to created architecture, adding in objects takes a few line, new textures or buttons are also quick, basically all about that game engine


Conclusion
compare planned time with actual time
unable to use much shaders as jpct takes it out. simpler to use therefore, but unable to apply any knowledge from shader programming, or produce any detailed lighting/ effects
